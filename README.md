_A tool for probabilistic QoS-assurance, resource consumption and cost estimation of eligible deployments of Fog applications._

This version of FogTorchΠ exploits [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) building tool and has been adjusted to support multithreaded Monte Carlo simulations.

FogTorchΠ is based upon the work described in
