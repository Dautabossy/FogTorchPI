_A tool for probabilistic QoS-assurance, resource consumption and cost estimation of eligible deployments of Fog applications._

This version of FogTorchΠ supports multithreaded Monte Carlo simulations.

FogTorchΠ is based upon the work described in

### Other FogTorchΠ Projects

FogTorchΠ has been also extended and used to simulate mobile task offloading in the context of Edge, as described in

- Vincenzo De Maio and Ivona Brandic. _"First Hop Mobile Offloading of DAG Computations."_, to appear in CCGRID'18. [Code](https://bitbucket.org/vindem/fogtorchpi-extended).
